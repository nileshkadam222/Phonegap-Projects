  <h2>What is character encoding?</h2>
  <h5>Character encoding is a method of converting bytes into characters. To validate or display an HTML document properly, a program must choose a proper character encoding.

The most common character set or character encoding in use on computers is ASCII The American Standard Code for Information Interchange, and this is probably the most widely used character set for encoding text electronically.

ASCII encoding supports only the upper- and lowercase Latin alphabet, the numbers 0-9, and some extra characters which make a total of 128 characters in all. You can have a look at complete set of Printable ASCII Characters

However, many languages use either accented Latin characters or completely different alphabets. ASCII does not address these characters; therefore you need to learn about character encodings if you want to use any non-ASCII characters.

The International Standards Organization created a range of character sets to deal with different national characters. For the documents in English and most other Western European languages, the widely supported encoding ISO-8859-1 is used.</h5>
